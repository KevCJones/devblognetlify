Not another coders blog! I'm afraid so, but don't worry - this is a blog for me not you, but if you find value in what I’m writing for myself, that's cool too.

## Who are you? Why Blog? What do you write about?

Who am I? We could get into some existential conversation about who I am. but I’ll keep this as short and to the point as I can.

### Who

I'm Kev, child of '82, husband and father of a two-year-old and a Lead Frontend Engineer at Push Doctor. I've spent many years writing shit code and have just started to understand how and what good code looks like. I've decided that now is perhaps the best time to start sharing some of those lessons I’ve learned from other people who got to this point ahead of me. I want to say it's altruistically driven - but it isn't. Part of how I learn is by teaching and explaining. If you can explain something simply it means you've understood it well enough to abstract it...

## Why

So here I am, ready to essentially start dumping about what it is I learn about into something that others can look at. I've considered blogging in the past too - in fact I’ve managed to successfully start and give up on about 3 blogs so far. The trouble with blogging for me has always been about 'why?' and 'what?' I’m blogging for. In the past it was 'to show I know what I am talking about?' which was a debatable outlook in retrospect. Now it's an exercise in learning and through that you might learn something too... so yeah that'

## What

Apart from this self-indulgent first post you can be assured this blog will more than likely be all about coding, and the many facets which come from that side of my life. My professional stack right now is focused around creating Angular apps but I’m an avid learner and I think it's vital you keep abreast of current technologies so there will be posts on other stacks when I venture out of my comfort zone. Being they're still quite a small company, we take on a lot of the devops solutions ourselves too, so I will from time to time share the trials and tribulations of getting CI/CD pipelines to bend to my will.
The technology is just the tool, the craft is knowing how to use those tools and each tool has strengths and weaknesses. do not expect any articles that border on the zealot about a platform. Some I like, some I do not - that's about my preferences not their capabilities and uses.
